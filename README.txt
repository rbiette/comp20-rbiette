PURPOSE:
THIS REPOSITORY HOLDS SEMESTER PROJECTS FROM COMP20. IT HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE TOPICS LEARNED DURING FALL 2017.

FAVORITE ASSGN:
MY FAVORITE ASSIGNMENT WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST ASSIGNMENT WHERE WE MADE OUR PORTFOLIO. HAVING NO WEB PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCE ONLY WEEKS BEFORE AND THEN CREATING A FUNCTIONING WEB PAGE WAS FASCINATING AND EXCITING FOR ME. I PLAN TO GO BACK AND EDIT THIS ASSIGNMENT.

GROWTH:
I HAVE GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE DAY 1 OF THIS COURSE. HAVING ONLY COMP11 AND COMP15, IT WAS FASCINATING TO EXPLORE A DIFFERENT SIDE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE THAT I CONNECTED WITH MUCH MORE. I FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE WEB AND HOW IT WORKS THOUGH I STILL HAVE MUCH TO LEARN.

IMPORTANT THING:
A NEW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE! JAVASCRIPT. 
- I FEEL CONFIDENT WORKING WITH THIS LANGUAGE AND HAD NO IDEA HOW TO USE IT BEFORE STARTING THIS COURSE.
- I HAVE COMPLETED MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENTS REQUIRING THIS OF ME. WHETHER USING A FRAMEWORK SUCH AS TO COMPLETE ASSIGNMENT 3 OR USING IT FOR AJAX PURPOSES IN ASSIGNMENT 2, I KNOW HOW TO USE IT NOW.

TOPIC FOR FUTURE:
I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT FRONT END DEVELOPMENT. MORE SPECIFICALLY, I HOPE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT FRAMEWORKS LIKE REACT AND BOOTSRAP (WHICH I AM THROUGHT THE SEMESTER PROJECT).
