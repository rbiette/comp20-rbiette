RYAN BIETTE README 

I BELIEVE THAT ALL REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY. EACH OF THE ASSESSMENT POINTS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED. I FEEL AS THOUGH MY CODE COULD HAVE BEEN MORE MODULAR AND PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE ORGANIZED, BUT IT MEETS ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS. I HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH GITHUB AGAIN.

I HAVE DISCUSSED THE ASSIGNMENT WITH GARRETT DICKSON, DYLAN HONG, JULIA ROSENBERG, MP MONKS, ZACH MUNRO, JENNA FLEISCHER

I SPENT ABOUT 12 HOURS ON THIS ASSIGNMENT

I USED THE HAVERSINE FORMULA FROM:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript
